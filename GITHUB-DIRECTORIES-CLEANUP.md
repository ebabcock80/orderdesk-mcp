# GitHub Directories Cleanup Summary

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Commit:** `dd5d751`  
**Status:** ✅ `.cursor` REMOVED, `.github` ANALYZED

---

## ✅ What Was Done

### **`.cursor` Directory - REMOVED from GitHub**
- ✅ Removed from git tracking
- ✅ Committed and pushed
- ✅ Still exists locally (already in `.gitignore`)
- ✅ Will not appear on GitHub going forward

**Files Removed:**
- `.cursor/mcp.json` (Cursor IDE settings)
- Plus other Cursor-specific files

---

## 📁 `.github` Directory - Analysis

### **MUST KEEP:**

#### **`.github/workflows/ci.yml` (130 lines) ✅ KEEP**
**Why:** This is your **CI/CD pipeline**!

Without this file, GitHub Actions won't run:
- ❌ No automated linting
- ❌ No type checking
- ❌ No automated tests
- ❌ No Docker builds
- ❌ No integration tests

This file contains the 5 automated jobs we set up in Phase 0:
1. Lint (ruff + black)
2. Type Check (mypy --strict)
3. Test (pytest with >80% coverage)
4. Docker Build
5. Integration Tests

**Recommendation:** **KEEP THIS FILE** - It's essential for automated quality checks.

---

### **OPTIONAL (Can Remove):**

#### **`.github/CODEOWNERS` (3 lines) - Optional**
**Content:**
```
# Code owners for OrderDesk MCP Server
* @ebabcock80
```

**Purpose:** Automatically requests your review on all PRs.

**Options:**
- **Keep:** If you want automatic PR review requests (useful if you add collaborators)
- **Remove:** If it's just you and you don't need this automation

**Recommendation:** **Remove if it's just you**, keep if you plan to add collaborators.

---

#### **`.github/pull_request_template.md` (32 lines) - Optional**
**Purpose:** Provides a PR template with checkboxes for:
- Type of change (bug fix, feature, etc.)
- Testing checklist
- Code review checklist

**Options:**
- **Keep:** If you want structured PR descriptions
- **Remove:** If it's just you and you don't need PR templates

**Recommendation:** **Remove if it's just you**, keep if you want PR structure.

---

## 🎯 Recommendation Summary

### **For Solo Development:**

**KEEP:**
- ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - **Essential for CI/CD**

**REMOVE:**
- 🔴 `.github/CODEOWNERS` - Not needed for solo development
- 🔴 `.github/pull_request_template.md` - Not needed for solo development

This would leave only the CI/CD workflow, which is the only file you actually need.

---

## 🔧 How to Remove Optional Files

If you want to remove CODEOWNERS and the PR template:

```bash
cd /Volumes/EXT/Projects/orderdesk-mcp-server

# Remove optional GitHub files
git rm .github/CODEOWNERS
git rm .github/pull_request_template.md

# Commit
git commit -m "chore: Remove optional GitHub templates

- Removed CODEOWNERS (not needed for solo development)
- Removed PR template (not needed for solo development)
- Kept workflows/ci.yml (essential for CI/CD)"

# Push
git push origin main
```

After this, `.github/` would only contain:
```
.github/
└── workflows/
    └── ci.yml  (Essential CI/CD pipeline)
```

---

## 📊 Current Status

### **Directories on GitHub:**

```
.github/              ✅ KEEP (for CI/CD)
├── CODEOWNERS        🟡 Optional (3 lines)
├── pull_request_template.md  🟡 Optional (32 lines)
└── workflows/
    └── ci.yml        ✅ KEEP (130 lines) - ESSENTIAL!

.cursor/              ✅ REMOVED (now private)
```

### **What's Private Now:**
- ✅ `.cursor/` - Removed from GitHub
- ✅ `speckit.*` - Removed from GitHub (from previous cleanup)

### **What's Still Public:**
- ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - **Needed for automated testing**
- 🟡 `.github/CODEOWNERS` - Optional
- 🟡 `.github/pull_request_template.md` - Optional

---

## ✅ Verification

### **Check Locally:**
```bash
ls -la .cursor/
# Should show: directory exists locally
```

### **Check GitHub:**
Visit: https://github.com/ebabcock80/orderdesk-mcp

You should see:
- ❌ No `.cursor/` directory
- ✅ `.github/` directory present (with workflows/)

### **Verify CI/CD Works:**
Visit: https://github.com/ebabcock80/orderdesk-mcp/actions

You should see:
- ✅ CI pipeline runs automatically on push
- ✅ All 5 jobs execute (lint, typecheck, test, docker, integration)

---

## 🎯 Your Options

### **Option 1: Keep Everything (Current State)**
**Result:** `.github/` with CI/CD + optional files
**Good for:** If you might add collaborators later

### **Option 2: Remove Optional Files (Recommended for Solo)**
**Result:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` only
**Good for:** Solo development, maximum privacy
**How:** Run the commands shown above

### **Option 3: Do Nothing**
